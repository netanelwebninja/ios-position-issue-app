# iOS Position Issue App

To see the problem, run the app on iOS simulator/device and then focus some input.
When the input is focused, the device keyboard is open and try scroll the page while the keyboard is open.
Scroll down and up, the header/footer will disappear or fly around the screen.
When you blur the input everything revert no normal.
